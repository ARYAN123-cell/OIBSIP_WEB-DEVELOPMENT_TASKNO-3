During my internship, I designed and developed a Temperature converter website focused on web development. The project 
involved creating a user-friendly interface that adapts seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes. I
implemented modern design principles and ensured optimal performance by utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The
Temperature converter website features engaging visuals and clear calls to action, effectively showcasing the services offered and 
enhancing user experience. This experience sharpened my skills in responsive design and front-end development, 
preparing me for future projects in the field.
